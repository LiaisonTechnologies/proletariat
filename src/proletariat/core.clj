  Args

    n        - the number of times to retry.  If < 0, will retry indefinitely

    on-retry - (optional arity) function that is called prior to the retry when
               an exception is thrown, but there are still retries available.
               Default is a no-op.  The function takes 2 arguments: first is
               the number of times retried (first retry will be 0, second will
               be 1, etc) and the second is the exception that was thrown.
               It is presumed that this funciton is for side effects (eg:
               logging) and any result will be ignored.
    on-fail  - (optional arity) function that is called after all retries have
               been exhausted.  The result of this function will be returned as
               the final result of `retry*`.  The default is to throw the final
               exception.  The function takes 1 argument: the final exception.

  processing will stop immediately and that exception thrown, with no further
